Readme - Sensor code for Soil moisture 

DESCRIPTION:
Code based on from Hello World template.
The code reads analog values from the sensor and converts into digital values and outputs it using an ADC.


PERIPHERALS USED:
This example exercises the following peripherals:
- STDOUT device (UART or JTAG UART)

SOFTWARE SOURCE FILES:
This example includes the following software source files:
- hello_world.c

BOARD/HOST REQUIREMENTS:
This example requires only a JTAG connection with a Nios Development board. If
the host communication settings are changed from JTAG UART (default) to use a
conventional UART, a serial cable between board DB-9 connector  and the host is
required.
